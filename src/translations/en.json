  "FQA.question_1_answer": "Answer : MADimob, a pioneering real estate agency in Romania, offers a streamlined and simple solution for purchasing property using cryptocurrency, tailored to align with Romanian legislation. Here‚Äôs how the process works: Seller Experience: When a property is sold through MADimob, the seller does not have to interact with cryptocurrency. They will receive the payment in RON (Romanian Leu), ensuring full compliance with Romanian legal standards. This approach eliminates the need for the seller to engage with cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Tradesilvania, Tokero, or others, which can be complex and burdensome. Buyer Process: For the buyer, the process is straightforward and user-friendly. Initially, the buyer undergoes a standard KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure. This is a typical compliance check to ensure all transactions adhere to legal and financial regulations. Payment Link Generation: Once the KYC process is successfully completed and everything is in order, MADimob generates a payment link for the buyer. This link facilitates the payment in cryptocurrency. Transaction Timeline: The entire transaction process, from the initiation of payment to the finalization of the property transfer, can be efficiently completed within 3-5 days. This quick turnaround is subject to the successful completion of the KYC process and the availability of all parties to meet at the notary for the final transaction. Finalization at the Notary: The actual transfer of property ownership and the finalization of the transaction are conducted in front of a notary, similar to traditional property purchases. This ensures that all legal requirements are met and that the transfer of ownership is duly recorded and official. Through this innovative approach, MADimob simplifies the process of buying real estate with cryptocurrency in Romania, making it accessible and hassle-free for both buyers and sellers, while ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations.",

  "FQA.question_2_answer": "Answer : Purchasing real estate with cryptocurrency through MADimob is as safe as conducting transactions with traditional fiat currency, thanks to their specialized approach. Here are the key safety features: Dynamic Interactive Payment Link: To address the common issue of cryptocurrency volatility, MADimob uses a dynamic interactive payment link for transactions. This link updates the payment amount to reflect real-time market values of the cryptocurrency at the exact moment the payment is made. This innovative feature significantly reduces the risks associated with the fluctuating value of cryptocurrencies, ensuring that the payment amount is accurate and fair based on current market conditions. Seller Receives RON: The seller in a MADimob transaction receives payment in Romanian Leu (RON), not in cryptocurrency. This approach not only simplifies the process for the seller, who may not be familiar or comfortable with cryptocurrency, but also ensures that the transaction is fully compliant with Romanian laws and regulations. By converting the cryptocurrency to RON, the transaction adheres to the legal and financial standards required in Romania. 100% Compliance with Romanian Laws and Legislation: MADimob places a strong emphasis on legality and compliance. Every transaction conducted through MADimob is structured to be 100% compliant with the existing laws and legislation in Romania. This adherence to legal standards assures both parties in the transaction that their interests are protected and that the transaction is conducted within the bounds of Romanian law. In summary, buying real estate with cryptocurrency through MADimob incorporates safeguards against the inherent risks of cryptocurrency, such as volatility, while ensuring legal compliance and ease of transaction for both buyers and sellers. This approach offers a secure and innovative way to leverage the benefits of cryptocurrency in real estate transactions",
